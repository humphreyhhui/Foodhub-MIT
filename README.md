Here is a project I did for the MIT Applied Data Science Program, where I:
- Created univariate and bivariate visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify trends and patterns in customer behavior.
-	Conducted in-depth analysis of data insights and presented actionable recommendations to optimize business operations and customer satisfaction.
